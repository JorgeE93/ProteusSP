FPrime is an embedded systems framework. The framework has been a reliable way to minimize development costs, schedule, and effort in small embedded missions. These missions include CubeSats, small-sats, and deployables. F' can be used for any embedded system regardless of the project size or field. 

F' was built to meet the following goals:
- Capture the reusability of embedded projects into a Framework
- Ease the separating and reassembling of shareable system components ???
- Isolate components for ease of testing
- Adapt easily to new contexts
- Port to new architectures and platforms
- Be easy to use
- Scale and configure to meet new use cases
- Preform well in resource-constrained context
